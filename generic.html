									<h1>Bio</h1>
								</header>
								<p>I was born in Buenos Aires in 1992, third from 4 siblings. I've lived in Florida, Vicente Lopez since then and until the year 2000, when we moved to the country side, to the city of Las Flores. I lived there uninterrumped until the year 2008, where I started to assist school at <i>"Instituto Adventista de Balcarce"</i> for 3 years as boarding pupil. I finished high school with the best average scores of my course. After that, I started Electronic Engineering at the <i>"Universidad de Buenos Aires"</i> in the year 2011. After not making much progress other than passing a few classes, I discovered that I preferred to work on stories and characters rather than physics and engineering. So, I decided to enroll into <i>"Escuela Da Vinci"</i> to study animation. Currently I'm working on my thesis and making 4 courses (frontend development, introduction to Python programming, english, and socio-emotional skills).</p>
								<h2>Work</h2>
								<p>I've worked with some institutions to make their videos, and made a couple projects for a video game company that no longer exists. Lately, I recorded some tutorials for a school in Panam√°, and also worked with DeTuco Estudio for a couple of animated shorts they made. I'm currently workiing with Luciana Talquenca making an animated short as a videoclip for a song of hers.</p>

										<h3>My character</h3>
										<p>
											I consider myself collaborative, very willing to help, and responsible. I don't refuse to face a challenge, specially if I consider the reward is worth it. Whenever I start something, I <b>will</b> finish it.
